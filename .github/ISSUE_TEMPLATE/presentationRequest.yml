      Ideally you should learn about PGP & provide me your contact details via an encrypted message that can be decrypted only by you and me
      My Current PGP key is on my github profile readme.
      Ideally using your gh handle and this repo as a password i.e. kilasuit/DocTypes
      Don't know about PGP? there are other services that you can use like temp.pm & intime I will build & run my own
      Want me to walk through PGP with you? let me know and
